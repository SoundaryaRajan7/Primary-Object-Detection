# Segment Anything Box Prompt - Object Cropping

This project uses Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment and crop a primary object using a **box prompt**.

## üñºÔ∏è What it does

- Loads an image
- Lets the user draw a bounding box on it
- SAM predicts a mask for the object in that box
- The cropped object is saved automatically
